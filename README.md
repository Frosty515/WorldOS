## Latest Changes - 24/09/2023

- Changed syscall entry so interrupts can be enabled while in system calls. This also means that the Kernel GS base is only accessible when needed.
- No longer set kernel gs base in `x86_64_enter_user` because it is redundant as the scheduler already does this.
- Added alignment member to the end of the `x86_64_Registers` structure
- Implemented `div`, `udiv`, `ldiv` and `uldiv` functions in assembly in kernel instead of in C due to inconsistencies in the compiler
- Improved bitmap class so the code is nicer and more efficient
- Changed RegisterFrame layout in Thread class to allow user stack to be saved easier and for the kernel stack to be accessed easier
- Added some read/write validation functions to the process class so userspace pointers/strings can be checked before being used by the kernel
- Added a SyncRegion function to the Process class to ensure the VirtualRegion of the Process matches the VirtualRegion of the Process's PageManager
- Added an `IsValidPath` function to the VFS to check if a path exists or not
- Marked the `VFS::GetMountpoint` function has `const` so it can be called in more places
- Copied `strchr` and `strrchr` functions from LibC over to the kernel
- Added all the C++11 errno values to `LibC/include/errno.h` and copied them over to the kernel
- Added read function to TTY that simply zeros the buffer provided as no user input mechanism is support
- Added proper file descriptor management. A file descriptor is a non-zero 64-bit signed integer that represents a TTY, a FileStream or Debug
- Converted all the kernel stdio functions to use this new system and implemented `fopen`, `fclose`, `fread` and `fseek` functions.
- Added a FileDescriptorManager to the Thread class. By default stdin is opened as read-only with ID 0 to KTTY, stdout and stderr as write-only with ID 1 and 2, respectively, to KTTY and stddebug as write-only with ID 3 to Debug
- Implemented `open`, `close`, `read`, `write` and `seek` system calls
- Copied over kernel stdio code to LibC with minor modifications. Currently only 8 streams can be opened simultaneously, not including stdin, stdout, stderr and stddebug. No streams are buffered as userland memory allocation is not supported yet.
- Implemented basic C assertions in LibC. Currently only prints to debug, but can print to stdout if a line is uncommented.
- Implemented stack protector in LibC

See notes if your system cannot meet these requirements

### System Requirements

- At least 256MiB able to be allocated to QEMU.
- Host that is capable of running x86_64 virtual machines in QEMU.
- Host must be capable of allocating 1 core to a x86_64 QEMU virtual machine.
- Host must have KVM support

If you cannot meet these requirements, see notes

### **Windows**

#### Windows 10 Method 1

- install WSL2 and install a distribution to it
- follow the steps for Linux -> (distribution you chose), except remove `qemu` from the install list (in WSL2)
- install `qemu` from [its website](https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows) and add it to `PATH`

#### Windows 10 Method 2

- install WSL2 and install a distribution to it
- follow the steps for Linux -> (distribution you chose)
- install an X-server on your Windows 10 host such as [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/)
- in WSL2, run `export DISPLAY = :0` as non-root (I recommend adding this to your startup script in WSL2, otherwise you will have to run this every time you open WSL2)

#### Windows 11

- install WSLg and install a distribution to it
- follow the steps for Linux -> (the distribution you chose)

### Linux

#### Debian

- run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo mtools curl qemu git m4 automake autoconf bash nasm libtool patch`

#### Fedora/RHEL

- run `sudo dnf install gcc gcc-c++ make bison flex gmp-devel libmpc-devel mpfr-devel texinfo mtools curl qemu git m4 automake autoconf binutils bash nasm libtool patch`

#### Arch

- run `sudo pacman -Syu base-devel gmp libmpc mpfr mtools curl qemu git bash nasm`

#### Gentoo

- run `sudo emerge --ask --verbose sys-devel/gcc sys-devel/make sys-devel/bison sys-devel/flex dev-libs/gmp dev-libs/mpc dev-libs/mpfr sys-apps/texinfo sys-fs/mtools net-misc/curl app-emulation/qemu dev-vcs/git sys-devel/m4 sys-devel/automake sys-devel/autoconf sys-devel/binutils apps-shells/bash dev-lang/nasm sys-devel/libtool sys-devel/patch`

## Building

1. run `make -j<jobs>` in the appropriate place for your OS (WSL2 for Windows 10, WSLg for Windows 11, etc.). `<jobs>` should be the amount of parallel threads to run. NOTE: If the toolchain isn't built and installed to the correct location, it **will** be built and installed

## Build and Run - Unix like, Windows 11 and Windows 10 method 2

1. run `make -j<jobs> config=<config>` in the appropriate place for your OS (WSL2 for Windows 10, WSLg for Windows 11, etc.). `<jobs>` should be the amount of parallel threads to run. `<config>` should be either `debug` or `release`. NOTE: If the toolchain isn't built and installed to the correct location, it **will** be built and installed.

## Running - Other

Run the following command(s) in the appropriate place for your OS (WSL2 for Windows 10 Method 2, cmd/powershell for Windows 10 Method 1, etc.) based on what configuration you want.

### Debug

1. run `qemu-system-x86_64 -drive if=pflash,file=ovmf/x86-64/OVMF.fd,format=raw -drive format=raw,file=iso/hdimage.bin,index=0,media=disk -m 256M -debugcon stdio -machine accel=kvm -M q35 -cpu qemu64`

### Release

1. run `qemu-system-x86_64 -drive if=pflash,file=ovmf/x86-64/OVMF.fd,format=raw -drive format=raw,file=iso/hdimage.bin,index=0,media=disk -m 256M -machine accel=kvm -M q35 -cpu qemu64`

## Notes

### System Requirement info

- You might be able to run WorldOS with less RAM (by changing the '256M' to the amount of RAM you want), but I cannot guarantee that it would run on any less than 256MiB.
- You computer **must** be capable of virtualization to run WorldOS in a VM.
- You can allocate more than 1 core, but only 1 will be used.
- KVM can be disabled, you will just need to remove `-machine accel=kvm` from the QEMU command line. It doesn't make much of a performance boost by using it, so it doesn't *have* to be enabled.

### Program Requirement info

- You can use alternatives to `curl` (such as `wget`), but you will have to modify the `Makefile`.

### Building and Running

- Make sure to follow the setup steps before building and running.

### Other platforms

- All modern POSIX operating systems (including MacOS X) should be able to build and run this OS. It might just take a bit more effort.
- Windows versions that don't support WSL2 or WSLg might require a lot more effort to get this OS running, so I recommend to just install a Linux Virtual Machine on those.
